# nginx frontproxy

The proxy uses a prebuilt, otel-equipped image and is ready to be reconfigured.

1. instrument nginx with `opentelemetry` so it does propagate trace-context and forward
   telemetry to alloy
2. look at how the introduction of otel traces in nginx changes the service graph and
   understand why the situation is why it is
